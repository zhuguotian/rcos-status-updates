## Last Week's Accomplishments

Haven't done much through this week due to two heavy team project, but here comes the last semester sum up review.

Throughout the whole semester, we have:
 - clean up the repo on Github(created 4 new sections for the branched the project) 
 - created/trained on LSTM lyric generation model(developed into GAN and diffusion map model in later semester)
 - read and learn an in-depth google wave-net model paper.  
 - and finally attempted to implement the wave-net model from scratch. 

I would say in general this semester involves a lot of study process(All the OG member graduated and I was taking machine learning from data during the semester), but we do have some initial level code work done and that set up a good foundation for the further work on the project.
