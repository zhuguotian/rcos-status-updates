## Last Week's Accomplishments

So after the discussion meeting during the weekend, here is what generally what needs to be done for the deep synth part:
- build our own WaveNet model
- write a dataset generator
- write the loss function(the one that compare the go input and our output)

## This Week's Plan

Modifies the WaveNet model from the repo
Prepare for the presentation

## Anything Blocking?

I foresee troubles will bump out when actual implementation start

## Notes
