## Last Week's Accomplishments
Got the Keras tutorial done and start to construct the wave-net model.

## This Week's Plan

consider the features to be extracted for my wave-net model and start to build the model 

## Anything Blocking?

Have been reading a paper about grid search and it turns out that grid search gives a worse result than random picking an number(which is kind of shocking). Need to find the hyper-parameter for my wave-net and I am kind confused now about how to decide the value.

## Notes
